Keyboard Scrambler is a fun game for Android that I made. Keyboard Scrambler scrambles the order of the letters of your keyboard and makes you try to type actual words (as opposed to random characters) and numbers. The score is based off of the time it takes to type those words divided by the number of characters with the number of mistakes subtracted. There are three levels: Easy: Just one word, no numbers, Medium: one word and one two digit number, and Difficult: either three words and two numbers or two words and three numbers.
